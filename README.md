# album art mirror

Mirrors the Cover Art Archive collection.

The Internet Archive, which graciously hosts the collection, does not serve them at a very high data rate.

The solution used here to this problem is to (A) very aggressively cache images, and (B) compress on-the-fly.

You can either download the original (either jpeg or png) with e.g.
https://aart.yellows.ink/release/5c034115-4998-4d4b-8f41-c2eab904864b,
or download in a webp with e.g.
https://aart.yellows.ink/release/5c034115-4998-4d4b-8f41-c2eab904864b.webp.

The webps will be lossless if the original was a png.
